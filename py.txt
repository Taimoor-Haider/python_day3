Value types are immutable and have different address in memeory --id()
Reference types are array and objects --- is --> False
For List (To get the index and value at same time) --> enumerate()
For Objects (To get key-value pairs) --> object.items()
For Objects (We also use the --->enumerate) to get the array with indexes and values at that indexes
is --> True for value types
in --> Used to check wheather something is in the iterable
not --> 2 not in list
and --> Both conditions are True
or --> any one condition is True
grouping condition using paranthesies
No switch-case statement in python
Use Range function for for loop to have both the element and the index
range(10) --> starts from 0 and ends at 9 (10 is exclusive)
range(5,10) --> starts from 5 and ends at 9 (last number is exclusive)
range(1,10,2) --> starts from 1 and ends at 9 (increament by 2)
List Comprehension--> el*2 for el in list
separator_string.join(iterable)
string.split(separator)
Dict Comprehension 
stats=[('age',20),('height',180),('weight',80)]
stats_dict={key:value for (key,value) in stats}
Destructuring is referred to as Unpacking
